    <subject>Supply Desk Central Charge Increase - 1st May 2019</subject>
    <textOnly>Good Morning,

At Supply Desk, we have been be able to maintain our charge rates without any centralised charge increases in the last few years.

In recent times, we have been required by law to auto-enrol our candidates, who work in your schools, into the Government Work Place Pension Scheme - as well as paying into the Apprenticeship Levy(a combined total increase in ‘on costs’ of 2.5%). Supply Desk has worked to absorb this cost, not increasing the charge to our client schools.

From April 2019, the minimum employer contribution rises to 3%  (bringing the combined cost of pension contributions and apprenticeship levy to 3.5%).

Accordingly, in order to pay our candidates legally and fairly, we have had to review our charge rates to take account of this rise. As a result there will be an increase in our rates of 2.7%.

From 1st May 2019, this increase will be applied to all of our charge rates.

If you have any questions or queries relating to the effective increase due to the rise of the minimum employer contribution, do not hesitate to contact us.

We would like to assure you of our commitment to providing you with the best service available and we thank you for your valued and continued business.

Kind Regards,

Supply Desk</textOnly>
