    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


We are looking for outstanding teachers and teaching graduates in Australia who are interested in teaching in the UK.

Register your interest today in a FREE UK teaching taster tour, including return flights and accommodation, and we&apos;ll guarantee you a teaching job in a UK school at the end of it.

Interested?

Successful teacher applicants will be flown to London. Teachers will take part in professional development workshops, before spending time observing, shadowing, team-teaching and meeting the staff in two of our best schools in the area.

During the trip teachers are offered a guaranteed teaching job at the school of their choice â€“ all whilst spending time getting to know the staff, students, school culture and highlights of the local area, so you can be sure it really is your perfect placement.
