    <subject>Interview at St Michael&apos;s Catholic School in Buckinghamshire</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear xxxx,



Are you interested in teaching in a Catholic school environment? Did you know, you don’t have to be a practicing Catholic to work in a UK Catholic School. Catholic schools value and respect all staff members regardless of backgrounds or beliefs and promote and support the vocation of teaching.



Teach In is working with a number of UK Catholic Diocese to support their recruitment drive for teachers to work in high-performing schools across the UK; including popular locations for Canadian teachers.

On behalf of Garret Fay, and colleagues, at St Michael’s School, we are interviewing in April for September 2019 and 2020 positions at this unique school in Buckinghamshire. Teachers from all faiths and backgrounds are welcome to apply.

Working in a Catholic school can offer you the following benefits:

You will be teaching in a school environment that aligns with Catholic values, but embraces and welcomes teachers of all faiths and backgrounds.
Teaching Religious Education is a core school focus.
A Catholic school is well placed to support the training needs of an Canadian teacher.

Skype interviews are being conducted with Garret Fay, Executive Headteacher, in Canada throughout April.

Visit our website to register your interest today

Click here to complete your details and one of our Catholic Schools team will be in touch to book your interview.

Any questions, contact me on (44)7540972420 or email Jaime.Tighe@teachin.co.uk

Kind Regards,
