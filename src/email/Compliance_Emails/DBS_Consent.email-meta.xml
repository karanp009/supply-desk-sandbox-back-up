    <subject>Consent for candidate with DBS in process</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear XXXX



I explained to you during our recent phone call that, although the DBS check is in process in respect of {!TR1__Closing_Report__c.TR1__Person_Placed__c}, we have not yet received the certificate. All other vetting and background checks, including the barred list check, have been completed.


You confirmed that you are happy for {!TR1__Closing_Report__c.TR1__Person_Placed__c} to work on a temporary assignment at {!TR1__Closing_Report__c.TR1__Account__c}, whilst the DBS check is in process and you accept that Supply Desk is not liable in these circumstances for any matter related to the status of the DBS check.

We agree to supply {!TR1__Closing_Report__c.TR1__Person_Placed__c} on this basis, and will notify you, when the DBS certificate has been received, if any relevant information is revealed.


Kind regards,



{!TR1__Closing_Report__c.TR1__Job_Credit__c}</textOnly>
