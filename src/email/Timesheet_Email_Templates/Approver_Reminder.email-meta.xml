    <textOnly>Dear {!TR1__Timesheet__c.TR1__Approver_First_Name__c},

You have timesheets that are awaiting your approval.

Please log in to the Supply Desk Community and approve the timesheets as soon as possible for the week ending {!TR1__Timesheet__c.TR1__Week_Ending__c}.

Timesheets approved after 11am on a Tuesday cannot be guaranteed to be included in the above week ending payroll. Please be aware, this will delay both your invoice creation and our payment to the candidate.

Kind Regards,

Supply Desk</textOnly>
