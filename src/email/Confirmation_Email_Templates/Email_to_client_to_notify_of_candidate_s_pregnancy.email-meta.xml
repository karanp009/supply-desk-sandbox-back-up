    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Salutation}{!Contact.LastName},

I refer to our recent telephone conversation during which we discussed that {!TR1__Closing_Report__c.TR1__Person_Placed__c} is pregnant. Please assess whether there are any risks posed to {!TR1__Closing_Report__c.TR1__Person_Placed__c} with regard to her health and safety in undertaking the assignment at {!TR1__Closing_Report__c.TR1__Account__c} and what, if anything, can be done to avoid such risks.
If you do identify any specific risks, please let me know as soon as possible. You should also discuss the risks with {!TR1__Closing_Report__c.TR1__Person_Placed__c}, together with steps she should take to avoid them.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,
{!TR1__Closing_Report__c.TR1__Job_Credit__c}</textOnly>
