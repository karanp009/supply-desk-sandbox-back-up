    <textOnly>Congratulations on completing your first booking with Supply Desk!


We hope you had a good day and we would love to hear all about it.


When you have time, could you give the office a call and feedback about your day to your consultant? We’d love the opportunity to have a chat about how your day went and answer any questions you might have, as well as give you any feedback that we’ve received from the school.


We look forward to your call, and to continuing to work together in the future.


Well done!


Kind regards,

Supply Desk</textOnly>
