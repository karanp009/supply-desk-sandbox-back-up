    <subject>Welcome to Supply Desk</subject>
    <textOnly>We are delighted to confirm that you are now cleared for work and would like to welcome you to Supply Desk, the education recruitment specialists.

Now that you are cleared for work, you can give your local branch a ring and inform them of your availability so you can find a job you love!

As starting in a new school is exciting, we thought we&apos;d also remind you to take your DBS certificate and ID to every school.

Kind regards,
Imogen Parker</textOnly>
