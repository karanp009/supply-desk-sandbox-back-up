    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},


This is an email from Supply Desk to inform you that payment is now due for your DBS Check.


Please click https://www.paypal.me/supplydesk/gbp45

to go to the PayPal payment page.


To use this service, you will need to have either an existing PayPal account or set up a new PayPal account, you can do this when you click the link.



You will be asked to log in to your PayPal account please DO NOT leave the page.


Important notice

DO NOT make direct payment to your consultant or compliance officer via the ‘Send Money’ facility in the PayPal app. If you do this, the payment will not reach Supply Desk Ltd and your DBS processing will be delayed. We will require you to make the payment again.



Please ensure you add your full name and Supply Desk Branch in the “add note” section so we can track your payment, failure to do so may delay our processing of your DBS application.


If you have any problems with the link please contact our finance team on our dedicated secure DBS line - 0114 245 8397 - and they will be happy to help.




Kind Regards

The Compliance Team
