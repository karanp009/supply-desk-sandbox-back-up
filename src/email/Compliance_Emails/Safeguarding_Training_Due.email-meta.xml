    <subject>Your Safeguarding Training is up for renewal on {!TR1__Associated_Qualification__c.Safeguarding_Expiry_Date__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We can see from our records that your Safeguarding Training is coming up for renewal on:
{!TR1__Associated_Qualification__c.Safeguarding_Expiry_Date__c}.
In line with current OFSTED requirements, it is best practice that all staff in schools receive training every year and that all new staff, including support staff and non-teaching staff, have undertaken safeguarding training.

If you have completed more recent Safeguarding Training please send us your up to date certificate so we can update our records.
If you would like to complete Supply Desk&apos;s Safeguarding Training please follow the below link and complete our ‘Safeguarding Awareness’ course and let us know when you complete it so we can update your record.
