    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name}




Congratulations. You are heading to the UK to teach.

DBS- terms of service

The next step in the clearance process will be to collect the following documentation from you:

Passport – Photo page
Visa - Right to Work in the UK
University Qualification – Full Certification / Transcript. You may still be a pre-service/qualifying teacher. Your transcript or qualification may be sent by your University at a later date in the year.
