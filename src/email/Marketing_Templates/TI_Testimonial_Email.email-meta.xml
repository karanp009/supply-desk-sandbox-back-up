&quot;This company helped me immensely throughout my placement at Greenacre Academy in Kent, UK. That experience completely opened my eyes to the new worlds of teaching that are possible, and that would not have been possible without the incredible support and constant friendly faces, such as yourselves, at Teach In. Moving over or doing a placement in the UK can be a challenge, but with the right people beside you, it feels like a breeze!&quot;

&quot;After teaching in Buckinghamshire, UK, for 15 months, it was VERY easy to get a teaching job back in Canada. Principals here know how difficult it is to teach over there. All I had to do was mention the fact that I was successful there, and I immediately got hired for a full-time continuing position in Special Education.  Because of the tremendous amount of personal growth that I went through, teaching in the UK was the absolute best thing I could have done for myself.&quot;

&quot;If youâ€™re an aspiring teacher, or even if you already are one, having the opportunity to live and work overseas is incredible.The importance of stepping out of your comfort zone, both personally and professionally, can do nothing but good. My time teaching in the UK was made possible by Teach In.&quot; Lucy
