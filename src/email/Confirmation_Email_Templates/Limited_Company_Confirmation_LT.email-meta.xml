Not withstanding the provisions of Clause 8.3 of the Terms of Engagement, please note that we calculate the ‘Intermediary Fees’ from day 1 of each Assignment based on the AWR comparator information with which we are provided by the Client i.e. the Intermediary Fees include an amount in respect of annual leave equivalent to the annual leave entitlement of the employees of the Client.  We would therefore advise that you make your arrangements with the teacher accordingly.  Please note that no additional sums will therefore be paid in respect of annual leave after the qualifying period.


Yours sincerely,
